- automotive -40+125C operating temperature on all devices!
- 1GB DDR3L
- Gigabit Ethernet interface
- Three USB 2.0
- Two FD-CAN
- Two ADC
- Two DAC
- Camera IF
- Six I2C
- Three I2S
- Three SD MMC
- FMC (NAND) Flash
- Six SPI
- Four UART
- MIPI DSI 3Gb (157 only)
- Secure Boot
- Crypto Hash (C version only)

STMP1-OLinuXino is designed in the same size and connector locations as A20-OLinuXino-LIME2 so being replacable and pin to pin compatible. 

STMP1-OLinuXino is manufactured in -40+125C operating temperature and targets industrial applications.
